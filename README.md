# Crop Recommendation System  

The **Crop Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based tool that helps farmers and agricultural professionals identify the most suitable crops based on environmental and soil conditions. It analyzes factors like soil type, climate, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pH to optimize yield and profitability.  

## Key Features  
- **Data Input**: Users provide soil, climate, and location details.  
- **Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, scales data, and processes categorical variables.  
- **ML Models**: Uses decision trees, random forests, SVM, and gradient boosting to make predictions.  
- **Model Training**: Trained on historical data and evaluated for accuracy.  
- **Recommendations**: Offers tailored crop suggestions based on input.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive platform for data input and results.  

## Technologies  
- **Python**: Primary programming language.  
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating ML models.  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Used for data analysis and numerical processing.  
- **Flask**: For web application development.  
- **HTML/CSS & JavaScript**: To create an interactive web interface.
